# Fraud-Detection-Using-ANN

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with Keras, a high-level deep learning API. The dataset is preprocessed, balanced using SMOTE, and scaled before training the model. Keras simplifies the process of building and training neural networks, making it ideal for supervised learning tasks like fraud detection.
